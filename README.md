# 🎓 Educational Booking System

## 📖 Description
- eRamoTask is a Flutter-based project where I created five fully functional screens with their logic in one day. The project is designed with a clean code structure, making it easily maintainable and scalable.

- The Educational Booking System is a mobile application designed to connect students with a variety of teachers for different subjects. It allows students to select subjects, choose preferred teachers, and handle payments seamlessly within the app, ensuring a smooth scheduling and educational planning experience.

Here is how you can write the folder structure from your screenshot into the README file:
